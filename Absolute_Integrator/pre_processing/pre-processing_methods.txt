Define any preprocessing methods you like in this folder.  For things to work automatically with the higher-level API, you must have two things:

1. a dictionary called "options" that lists your method's options.  For an example, see ranger.py.
2. A function named run, that takes its first argument to be the 2D image to preprocess.

Everything else is up to you.  Any additional arguments to your run function should be included in the "options"
dictionary.  This dictionary is used to automatically create UIs in the AI_UI project.  Aside from this, you are giving
people the map of what to tinker with.
